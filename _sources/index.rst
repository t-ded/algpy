Welcome to AlgPy!
=================

**AlgPy** is a Python library for everyone who ever struggled with grasping any data structure or algorithm problem
and/or felt like playing with the algorithm or data structure.

AlgPy approach boils down to these simple strategies that set it apart from other DSA libraries:

* **AlgPy is first and foremost a learning tool**
* **AlgPy is highly modular**
* **AlgPy is ruled by Explainability >> Performance**
* **AlgPy applies the concepts in practice**

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for information on how to get started.
